when we want to change a title on clicking a button. we cannot do this with normal variaables provided by javascript or react.

in this case we have to use state variables which maintains the state and it helps in 
reconciliation and in virtual DOM


- For using state variable we need to import useState  from react


How to declare a state variable?


for that we have to understand normal variable synatx 

const title = "Food Villa"


// state variable


const [variablename, function] = useState("Initial Value")

const [title, setTitle] = useState("Food Villa") // title variable has Food Villa Value



now onclicking the button we want to change the button

for that -
<h1> {title} </h1>
<button onCLick = {()=> setTitle("New Food App")}> Change title </button>








fetch() we use to fetch API 


there are two ways to load a page 

1) loads -> API(300ms time it takes) -> render page(500 ms)
// in this we will first call the API  and then it will laod the page

2) loads -> renders a template page(100 ms) -> API (300ms) -> update UI
// in this we will first render the template page ui and then do a API call


for 2nd option we have useEffect given by React Devs





// NOTE
there are two times when a component renders

- either the state changes 
- or props changes



useEffect:- 
what is useEffect? a hook
what is a hook? a normal js function

how do you call it? we pass two parameters 1. callback functions and 2. dependency array


example syntax

useEffect(()=>{

console.log("render")

}, [])

// this will call again and again so we pass a dependency array to it 

// in dependent array if we pass anthing, lets say searchText then the useEffect function will be dependent on it

// empty dependency array => once after render
// dependencies array [searchText] => once after render + eveery time after render















- when we try to fetch some data from swiggy API it will give us error(CORS Error)
- It is given by our erro. It says that  we cant let you connect to swiggy api with local host. 
- So for that we have install a extension called allow cors








- we use shimmer ui for  page content loading





// conditional rendering


meaning- if the data is there then load one ui and if not then load a different ui
